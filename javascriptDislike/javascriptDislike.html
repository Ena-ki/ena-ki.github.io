      Oh, JavaScript, why are you like that? <br>
      Why do you think classes are not classes? <br>
      It makes me sad. <br>
      <br>
      Oh, JavaScript, why do you think a word is a number <br>
      and a number is a word? <br>
      It makes me want to wear a jort. (see appendix 1.1) <br>
      <br>
      Oh, JavaScript, why do you have 5 null types? <br>
      One is already too much. <br>
      <br>
      I think I dislike JavaScript <br> 
      but the things that you make with JavaScript are cool <br>
      Oh why, oh why, JavaScript <br>
      Do you have to be that way? <br>
